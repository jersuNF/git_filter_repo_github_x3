		  A cooperative thread has a negative priority value. 
		  Once it becomes the current thread, a cooperative thread 
		  remains the current thread until it performs an action 
		  that makes it unready.
		  A preemptible thread has a non-negative priority value. 
		  Once it becomes the current thread, a preemptible thread 
		  may be supplanted at any time if a cooperative thread, 
		  or a preemptible thread of higher or equal priority,
